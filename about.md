A Trip to Japan

Hi! We're Sylvia and David. We graduated from Carnegie Mellon University this May. For
our last summer vacation, before entering the real world, we are traveling to Japan for two
weeks. We will be updating this blog daily (internet-permitting) with hopefully lots of
pictures of what we find in Japan!
