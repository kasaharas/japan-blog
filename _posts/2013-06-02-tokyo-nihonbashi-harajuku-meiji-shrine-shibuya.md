Nihonbashi
----------

After an early breakfast at around 7am, we decided to walk around Nihonbashi
since the weather was so nice. Instead of walking down the main street,
we walked in the direction of the more residential portion of the neighborhood.
A few blocks later, we were really pleasantly surprised when we discovered bridges, 
a river, and pretty scenery. Since it was a Saturday morning, we didn't see
many people and it made for a really nice walk.

We got back to the hotel, and planned to stay in and write yesterday's post.
Since we didn't want to go to Harajuku too early, we stayed in until around noon. 

Harajuku
--------

We took a 20 minute subway ride to Otome-sando Station. We got out of the station
and saw a lot of tall buildings and advertisements. We were starving, since we haven't
eaten since breakfast. So we started to look for a place to eat. After walking
a few blocks, we finally chose a Chinese restaurant. It was pretty typical Chinese
food, but it was good.

Otome-sando is a huge shopping district, with a lot of high-class stores. Maybe it's 
always very busy, but the amount of people there was crazy. We could see blocks ahead 
of us were full of people, and the crowd never thinned out. We wanted to get to
Harajuku, so we needed to walk a few blocks to get there. It took us forever to
get there because the streets were so packed. Along the way, we saw a lot of people
waiting for something. After some investigation, we found out they were waiting for
seats at restaurants. You might think these restaurants are high-class fancy restaurants,
but the two we saw were a popcorn store and a Hawaii'an (Hawaiin?) restaurant called
Eggs'n Things. People are crazy.

Harajuku is a shopping district for mostly very eccentric teenagers. The majority
of these stores are along a street called Takeshita-dori. It was almost as crowded
as Otome-sando, and it was much more narrow. The fashion styles range drastically.
We saw some girls in lolita dresses, a man dressed in all plaid, and other wild
outfits.

Walking around Harajuku was exhausting. Avoiding bumping into people and not losing
each other, while taking pictures was an ordeal. Once we got out, we just wanted
to sit down and stay still. Looking at the map, we saw that a park was close by
so we thought that would be a nice place to rest.

Meiji Shrine
------------

As soon as we got there, we realized that this wasn't a normal park. The entrance
was a huge Tori gate. It was cool to see a busy shopping district on one side of the
street, and a forest on the other. The forest enclosed a shrine of a previous emperor
and emperess. We saw a lot of pretty scenery, and eventually found the main shrine.
At this point, our legs were dead and we just wanted to sit down. We sat down for a while
and attempted to take as many pictures as we could and then left the park. There
are a lot more pictures, but I'll only post a few here. The rest will be on the flickr
set.

Shibuya
-------

Shibuya is a dense shopping and fashion district in Tokyo.

We got out at Shibuya Station, a very popular and crowded station. It turned out the scramble
crossing was right in front of the station! We joined the crowd and made our way acoss the
street and over to a large building overlooking the crossing.

The building had 5 floors: a
Starbuck's on the first two floors and then three floors of videos, CDs, manga, and books.
The second floor of Starbuck's was very crowded but you can get a great view of the crossing
if you wait for a seat.

After watching the crossing we headed back out into the streets to find a place to eat some
dinner. We found a building that just had 8 floors of food! The first floor had a huge 
display of sample dishes from each restaurant and then an elevator you can take to the
restaurant of your choice!

We chose the restaurant with tasty looking grilled meat and headed up. We found out that
the meat we saw was grilled ox tongue! Yum! Our food was great and we also got plum wine
(of course) on the side.

After dinner we headed back to Nihonbashi to our hotel. We were exhausted from walking 
and navigating large crowds all day! Time to sleep.
