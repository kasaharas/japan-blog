Since we spent our first day in Hakone doing very touristy and controlled 
sightseeing, we decided to spend our second day exploring the area on our own.
Of course, the day started off with a delicious breakfast at our ryokan.

During the numerous train rides through Hakone we had seen a few foot bridges.
We found one down the street from our ryokan so we checked it out. The water and
plant life were beautiful.

Next we stumbled across a shrine.

After a few hours of exploring the nearby area we headed up the mountain
to the train station above our ryokan. We decided to browse the town near
Hakone-Yumoto station, a more busy area of Hakone with small shops and
restaurants, and of course, more water and bridges.
