Leaving Tokyo
-------------

Sunday marked the end of our time in Tokyo. We headed to Tokyo Station to ride the
Shinkansen Kodoma. The Shinkansen bullet trains (except a select few) are free 
with the Japan Rail pass.

The ride to Odawara Station, the closest stop to Hakone, was nice. It was our first
time on a bullet train. We got to glimpse some of Japan's countryside and less urban
residential areas.

From Odawara Station we rode a smaller train to get to into Hakone. For those of you
who watch anime, Hakone is the setting of Evangelion. It is called Tokyo-3 in Evangelion,
but it is set in Hakone. This smaller train can be seen in the show.

Hakone
------

We quickly realized the beauty of Hakone. The region is covered in lush forests and
mountains, with small towns and houses sprinkled throughout.

Eventually, we were dropped off at a very remote looking train station up on a mountain
in Hakone! We weren't sure what to do at first so we just followed the path!

On the way we realized one of our bag's pocket's was open! Hey, that's where Sylvia put 
her dirty laundry! Oh no!

Don't worry everyone, we found it.

Sorry for that rollercoaster of emotions. Back to the journey to our hotel. Walk, walk, 
walk!

Finally we made it.

The hotel we are staying at is called a *ryokan*. They are traditional Japanese inns,
featuring matted floors, sliding doors, and public baths.

We quickly found out there are lots of rules when inside a ryokan! First off, guests 
are to wear yukata, a traditional japanese robe. There is a curfew, the doors
of the ryokan will be locked 11 pm. Guests are expected to be quiet while inside, even in
their rooms. No shoes allowed while in the ryokan, guests are given sandals to wear instead.

After exploring our room we headed downstairs to use the hot springs! There are public hot
springs (separate mens and womens) as well as private hot springs that can be reserved. 

After the hot springs it was time for dinner.
_A note to anyone planning on staying at a ryokan, be sure to sign up for the dinner._ There
are not many places open at dinner time in Hakone and the dinners typically served by ryokan
are very interesting and delicious.

Dinner ended with some tea and sorbet.

We don't know what kind of tea was served at the end of dinner but it was very good. Kind
of made you tingly inside. And feel a little funny. After being here a few days we have
a feeling this isn't normal tea...
