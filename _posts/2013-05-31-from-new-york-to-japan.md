Our flight departed at 1:25pm on May 29th from JFK in New York to Narita Airport in Tokyo.
We arrived at the airport pretty early, so we ate a snack and watched the latest Game
of Thrones episode while waiting to board. The plane boarded on time and we were 
on our way!

The plane was very big, and the seats were pretty comfortable. The legroom was
impressive, although our seats were nowhere near as nice as the first class and
business class. Each of our seats had a TV screen and a controller, with which
we could watch a lot of movies, play games, and look at our flight map.

JAL was a little more expensive than an American airline would have been, but it was well
worth it. The food and service were great. The flight attendants (all female)
were very nice and considerate, but their Japanese accents made their English speaking 
extremely difficult to understand. 

After lift-off, we watched a few episodes of Ergo Proxy on a laptop and then we were
given hot towels to wipe our hands on. We knew this meant some kind of food, so we
were excited. When we first bought the plane tickets, we were given the option
to choose any kind of special food exemption. Since David possesses a weak body
(lactose intolerant), we signed up for a low-lactose meal free of charge. He was
always served food first and they were completely different from regular meals.
Both kinds of meals were good, and we were surprised at the amount and quality.

height="333"></a>

For our first meal, David got fish on rice as his main dish and Sylvia got chicken 
with vegetables. After eating most of our meals, we were pretty satisfied when we 
saw the flight attendant pushing another cart of goodies down the aisle. Dessert? Yes, please. We were
each given a tiny Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream and hot green tea. This is the life.

After eating, we killed time by watching a strange nonsensical Japanese thriller
and played some games. David schooled Sylvia in reversi, but he probably cheated.
The guy next to David slept the entire 13 hours. He also had the same socks as David, 
and for some reason David thought that was awesome and forced Sylvia to take a picture.

Around six hours into the flight, we thought it was a good idea to imbibe alcohol. Especially
since it was free, we decided to have a date on the plane. We watched anime while drinking
tiny bottles of wine and eating a little snack. David got a fruit cup and a sandwich,
and Sylvia got bread.

height="333"></a>

We were served another meal around three hours before we landed. It wasn't as good
as the first, but we were still grateful. By this time, 10 hours had passed and neither
of us has slept and we were slowly getting restless.

For the first 10 hours of the flight, we felt pretty good. However, these last hours were
a struggle. David spent some time playing golf on the TV and he was awful. Sylvia played tetris,
but eventually my eyes started hurting due to intense concentration. We survived, and
our plane landed. As soon as we got off the plane, we could feel the humidity. Even in the
airport, we felt sticky and gross, but that was probably due more to the flight than the
weather. 

At the end we stopped taking pictures because we were too tired to take the camera out.
After getting off the plane we went through customs. While we were waiting in line we
were given a flyer about wearing face masks when you're sick in Japan. Since Sylvia
has a cough we were worried she was going to be tackled by customs if they heard
her. After collecting our bags we found a small currency exchange booth and exchanged
the cash we brought for yen. The transfer rate was 98.21, so we lost a little less
than 2% but this rate was MUCH better than the rate in JFK (we think it was around 
85).

The train ride to Tokyo Station (NEX) was comfortable. We slept the whole way so
there are no pictures :). From Tokyo Station to our hotel we just took 2 quick 
train rides and a short walk. Our Suica card didn't work on the first train but 
we "talked" (David flapped his arms) to one of the officials and they let us 
through. (The card is working now though!)

The second train let us off just a block from our hotel. We were outside for the
first time in about 18 hours!

We got to our hotel ready to pass out. Our room has a bed, a table, a bathroom and 
just the minimum amount of space to walk. Although it is small, it is comfortable.
We do have a fancy toilet, though we haven't tried out all it's "fancy features"
yet... It's strange how Japanese toilets are either high-tech or a hole in the 
ground.

By this time, we are exhausted, but also hungry. We left our stuff in the hotel room,
and went outside to find a quick bite to eat. We wanted something quick and easy and found
just the place around the corner from our hotel, called Hotto Motto. David ordered bibimbap
and Sylvia got something called kimchi combi. Our first meals in Japan were Korean dishes.

height="333"></a>

After getting the food, we went around the block to the 7-11 to look for an adapter. Most
Japanese outlets are 110 volts and are similar to American outlets except both holes
are the same size and there is no hole for the ground prong. Convenience stores are a big thing here, 
and are much more well stocked than their American counterparts. Our search
for an adapter was a failure, but we bought some onigiri and went back to the hotel.

**If you're interesting in traveling to Japan this information might be helpful
otherwise it's just going to be really boring!**

The [Japan Rail Pass](http://www.japanrailpass.net/eng/en001.html) gives us access
to lots of the trains that run throughout Japan (the long distance bullet trains, not the
intra-city subways). You have to purchase a voucher before coming to Japan and then
exchange it for the actual pass once you to Japan. You have unlimited access to
most JR railways with the pass for one, two, or three weeks. We found a JR Travel 
Service Center in the lower level of the airport, where we exchanged our
vouchers for the pass.

We bought a 14-day JR pass for each of us but we were actually staying for 15 
days (14 nights). And we need the JR Pass to get from Narita airport to
and from Tokyo station on the first and last day of our trip! Oh no! Well it
actaully worked out. Here's a breakdown of what we ended up doing:

1. Traveling from Narita to Tokyo Station costs 3,000 yen and can use the JR
   pass.
2. Traveling back from Tokyo Station to Narita costs more (around 4,000 yen 
   maybe). Again, you can use the JR Pass.
3. Traveling around Tokyo is done via subway and the Suica card is a card you 
   can use as a pass to get on the trains (you can't use the JR pass).

We were able to get a deal where we paid 3,500 yen for a ticket from Narita to
Tokyo Station along with a "free" 1,500 yen Suica card, and our JR Pass would
be activated the next day (so we could use it for the more expensive trip back).
Woohoo!
