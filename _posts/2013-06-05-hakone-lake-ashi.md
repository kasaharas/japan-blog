Onsen
-----

We woke up at 6am, wide awake. Since Hakone is known for its *onsens*,
hot springs, we decided to take a bath in the ryokan. There are two public
baths in our ryokan, one for women and one for men. Mid-day the baths for each
gender switch so that everyone can experience the different baths during their stay.
This makes it easy to accidentally walk into a room full of naked people of the
opposite gender. Thankfully that didn't happen! 

The baths were very relaxing. Japanese bathing etiquette differs from that of
America. A person is expected to wash their bodies outside of the tub, and then
afterwards soak in the tub full of hot water. Japanese families typically take
turns bathing, and share the same bath water. Since they are expected to wash
beforehand, the tub water stays clean. We were asked to follow this type of 
bath etiquette in the ryokan and were given instructions on how to do so when
we first checked in. We both really enjoyed the baths, and bathed twice everyday!
We don't have any pictures, because it would have been weird to bring a camera
into a public bath! Sorry! Here's a picture from the ryokan's website.

Breakfast
---------

After the baths, we had breakfast, which was included as a standard meal plan. 
Most ryokans serve breakfast and dinner. This was our first breakfast in the ryokan, 
and after eating such a great dinner, we were excited. And we were right to be, because
the food was delicious!

With our breakfast, we were given a small bowl consisting of some unknown food. 
David suspected it was cereal with some type of syrup. Upon opening the bowl, we
could smell that it was nothing that we've ever had before. Sylvia realized that
it was probably natto. Natto is a very smelly, sticky bean that some Japanese
find a tasty treat. Unfortunately, the appearence, taste, and smell was not for us!

Travelling to Lake Ashi
-----------------------

Lake Ashi is a fairly famous lake, where one can see Mt. Fuji on a clear day.
Unfortunately, Mt. Fuji is closed for visitors during this time of the year so
we couldn't go see it directly. So we decided to go to Lake Ashi instead, and
possibly catch a glimpse of it. Before going to Lake Ashi, we went to Hakone-yumuto 
station by bus. Once we arrived, we went to an information booth that gave us 
information on how to get to the lake. We bought the Hakone Free Pass, which is
3900 yen for two days and 4400 yen for three days in the "Free Area". This
pass allowed us to travel all over Hakone on many of the transportation vehicles
available. All of the transportation that we would take today was covered by
the pass. This included the train, cable car, ropeway, boat ride, and a bus back.

We could have simply taken a bus to Lake Ashi, but we wanted to take the scenic route.
The scenic route included a train ride up the mountain, a cable-car even further up,
and then a ropeway to the lake. The train ride up the mountain was really interesting.
In order to get up the mountain, the train went up a track and then went back in
the same direction after switching tracks. You can imagine the route the train took
to be a zig-zag up the mountain. Unfortunately, the train was crowded so we couldn't
take many pictures. Here is a picture of David eating a bread, called melon-bahn,
in front of the train. It was shaped like a melon, but it tasted sweet and sugary 
and it was amazing.

We got off the train at Gora station, where we would take the cable car up even
further to Sounzen. At this station, we also saw some gigantic parking cones.

The cable car went up a straight track. We later found out that there is only
one track, and two trains going in opposite directions simultaneously. The train
we were on met the other train and passed by each other.

After taking the cable car to Sounzen, we were able to get on the ropeway. We
let several elderly ladies go before us on the line while waiting, and one of them
gave us a pretzel snack! Sweeeeet.

From the ropeway, we could even see the top of Mt. Fuji! At least...we think it was
Mt. Fuji.

The ropeway had several stops on the way to Lake Ashi. The first stop was Owakudani,
which is famous for its natural hot springs and rivers that are resultant from
the active volcanic area. It is also famous for eggs cooked in the naturally hot water,
which turn the shells black because of the sulfur in the water. The sulfurous fumes
make the area smell like bad eggs all over the place. It was an awful smell, so
naturally, we walked towards them.

We got back on the ropeway, and a few stops later we were able to see Lake Ashi.

Once we got to Lake Ashi, we waited for the next boat ride onto the lake. While 
waiting, we saw a lot of stray cats.

The boat ride is only 970 yen and the boat looks like a pirate ship. We're not sure
why they chose a pirate ship, since culturally it doesn't fit at all, but it
was still cool to look at!

We finally got on the boat and took a ride across Lake Ashi. The scenery was really
pretty and the water was very serene.

We got off the boat at Moto-hakone, where we ate lunch. Most of the restaurants
were soba restaurants. Soba is a dish with chilled buckweat noodles served with 
a dipping sauce. In Japan it is considered a compliment to slurp your noodles!

After dinner we were craving some dessert and so we found an ice cream store!
David felt adventurous and got black sesame ice cream. Sylvia got plain chocolate.
It was delicious!

We were full and content, so we decided to go back to the hotel. We could take
a bus straight to Hakone-yumuto station and then a one stop train ride back
to the hotel. We have no pictures of the bus ride, but it was an extremely
narrow and meandering road down the mountain. Here are some pictures of Moto-hakone
as we waited for the bus departure!

Fabulous. 

That was pretty much our day! After that we spent some time 
in the ryokan relaxing. Here's a picture of the futons we slept on.
We could have chosen western style bedding, but we decided to experience
the more traditional futon. During the day, the futons were stored in a closet,
and for sleep we took them out. They were very comfortable.
