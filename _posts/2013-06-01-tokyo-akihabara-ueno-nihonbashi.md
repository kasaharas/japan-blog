Akibahara
---------

Due to jetlag, we woke up at 6am on our first day in Japan.
We were wide awake, so we got ready for the complimentary breakfast at the hotel.
The breakfast was a buffet of bread, hamburger patties, salad, and soup (meh). 
We planned to see Akihabara today. Akihabara is known for it's anime, manga, 
and general nerdiness as well as the Electric City. As anime fans, we were 
really looking forward to it! After a short walk from our hotel we took the 
subway to Akihabara Station.

We walked a few blocks from the station in search of Electric City, trying
not to run into the business people on their way to work. An interesting
thing about Toyko is that everyone wears suits, even store clerks at the
electronic stores. As soon as we saw buildings covered in anime, we knew we were there. Unfortunately,
most of the buildings were closed because it was too early! Since almost all of
the store fronts did not display their opening hours, we had no idea when
they would open. We spent around half an hour walking around the main street
taking pictures of the buildings.

Although it was early, a lot of people (mostly men) were waiting in line
for stores to open. We were wondering what they were waiting for. We found
out later there was some sort of raffle along with the release of an H-game.

height="333"></a>

Still waiting for the big buildings to open, we walked around Akihabara. There was
one large street with bigger buildings and small alleyways coming off the main
street with little shops and restaurants, including
maid cafes and other anime/manga stores. The streets were pretty empty
at this point, but it got very crowded later on in the day.

height="333"></a>

The buildings eventually opened and we were able to look around. Most
of the buildings sold the same types of goods ranging from 
anime and manga merchandise to gundam kits. A lot of the stores had 
around 6 floors and each floor was small but packed with things to buy. We also
saw some pachinko (similar to slots) and crane game stores (with 2 or 3 floors
dedicated to just different crane games!). We also went to an arcade, but we 
weren't allowed to take pictures. We played a game called pop'n'music, which is 
basically DDR but for your hands.

We started looking for a place to eat lunch around 12pm, so there were a lot of 
businessmen at every restaurant. We found a restaurant that was just a door and 
a staircase with some pictures of food. Since there was no line, we decided to 
try it. The restaurant had really good food priced for 600 to 800 Yen.

<div style="clear:both" />

The restaurant happened to have English menus, so ordering was easy. However,
if there wasn't any English we probably would have been okay with pointing
at pictures of the food. David got udon with a really tasty broth and pork.
He couldn't stop bringing up how good the broth was hours later. Sylvia got
curry and rice with donkatsu (breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet). For some
reason, she got the jumbo size and it was indeed jumbo. The waitress
was really nice and she even offered to take a picture of us together. For
those of you who plan to go to Japan, there is no tipping and you almost
always pay at the register.

Ueno
----

Ueno is a district of Tokyo most known for it's large park. We walked from Akihabara
to Ueno rather than taking the train. It only took about 15 minutes and we got to see
more of the surrounding area. While we were walking we passed a lady who was handing
out face masks. She held out a large stack to Sylvia so she could take one but Sylvia
decided, "I need a lot of masks!" and took the whole pile. After that we think the lady 
tried to grab some of them back but decided to just let us leave with them. 

We got to the park from the south, where there are two lakes.
One is covered with lots of lily pads and vegetation.

height="333" alt="DSC_0399"></a>

In the middle of the lake is a small shrine. We aren't sure what it was or if it was real,
it looked rather new but it could have just been renovated recently. There were cat fish in 
the lake and we got to watch them fight over crackers a man was throwing in to them.

The other lake was clear and had swan shaped paddle boats you could take out.

width="500" height="333" alt="DSC_0419"></a>

We walked north of the lakes and into the main part of the park. We found a small
path with lots of small torii gates the led to a few small shrines were we saw school
kids making wishes.

Back on the main path through the park we ran into a street magician who did a very
interesting trick...

In the center of the park is Tokyo National Museum.

In the large terrace in front of the building there was a bonzai tree 
festival! We took lots of pictures of the bonzai trees so be sure to check out our 
[flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96692645@N03/sets/72157633829180553/) 
for all of them! Here are some of our favorites:

The weather for our day at Ueno park was beautiful, but hot. After walking for so
long we stopped to toss frisbee in the shade. Luckily we didn't hit anyone! After
our break we headed back to our hotel to rest a bit from all the walking.

Nihonbashi
----------

Walking for so long through Akihabara and Ueno took a lot energy out of us. We
had planned to go into Shinjuku for dinner but didn't want to take the 30 minute
train ride to get there. So we walked around Nihonbashi (the district our hotel
is in) to look for dinner.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96692645@N03/8907009175/" title="tokyo_0148 by kasaharas, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/8907009175_3162bffbe4.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="tokyo_0148"></a>


We walked for a long time trying to find a restaurant that might have an english 
menu. Also, we felt underdressed since everyone that was out were buisiness people
in suits and dress clothes. Eventually we decided to just pick a restaurant and 
go for it. Of course, we picked the one with the giant bear at the entrance:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96692645@N03/8906963421/" title="tokyo_0156

width="500" height="333" alt="tokyo_0156"></a>

We walked in and the hostess came over to us and told us "No English menu." Oh no!
Sylvia skillfully asked in Japanese if they had pictures and he said yes! So we
were seated. The restaurant used an electronic menu system where you enter your order 
on the screen when you are ready and the food is brought out to you. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96692645@N03/8907609970/" title="tokyo_0152

width="500" height="333" alt="tokyo_0152"></a>

As it turned out, the hostess was able to find an english version of the menu so we were
saved! We got two dishes, grilled pork over rice and northern chicken cooked in an 
earthenware pot. The pork was good but the chicked was kind of bland (and there wasn't
much of it!). The restaurant was food from northern Japan. We splurged on some alcohol
and tried plum wine. It was delicious! We will probably be getting more of it on our 
trip. Here's a shot of the pork and the wine:

A cool thing about Tokyo is the bikes. Lots of people ride bikes to get around and
no one ever locks their bikes! There are tons of bikes around the city and they 
are never chained to anything.
