From Hakone to Kyoto
--------------------

Someone (ahem, David) left the camera on the night before we traveled to Kyoto
from Hakone. So unfortunately there are no pictures of our journey! But it was
rather simple, a quick train to Odawara station and then a 2 hour train ride
from there to Kyoto station. We were able to use our JR Pass again to ride
the trains between cities, however this time we didn't get to sit together
since the train was crowded.

We arrived in Kyoto station around 1 in the afternoon and it was very hot and
muggy out. The area around the station is very busy and crowded. Kyoto 
definitely has a city feel (and smell) but there aren't really any big buildings.
It's just quite dense. Our hotel was a few blocks from the station on Shijo-dori
(dori means street).

At the hotel we charged our camera and headed out for some food! We ended up 
at a cafe. Any fans of the anime Cross Game (like us) would really like this
cafe as it served the same food as Tsukishima's restaurant, namely Napolitan!
For anyone who hasn't seen the show, this food isn't really Japanese, but it's
very popular in Japan!

On the way back from the cafe we walked around the small backstreets that are
everywhere in Kyoto.

Back at the hotel we checked out the vending machines on our floor. They sell
beer out of vending machines! No ID checks here.

Nishiki Market & Teramachi Street
---------------------------------

Nishiki Market is a narrow shopping street full of restaurants and food-related
stores. The market is covered with a colorful roof that makes it really cool
to walk through. It smells like fish, but the colors and variety makes it pretty.
Unfortunately, we went too early, around 8:30 AM and almost all of the shops were
closed.

We walked down Nishiki Market, and found that it intersected with another covered
street called Teramachi Street. It was bigger than Nishiki Market, and not as
food-related. It consisted of mostly restaurants, clothing stores, and etc. 
Shops here were still closed too, so we walked through it pretty quickly, deciding
to come back later at night.

Since most of the stores were closed, we couldn't find any restaurants for breakfast.
There was a convenience store open, so we decided to try some ready made food there.
Sylvia really liked the napolitan she ate the day before, so she decided to get it in
pre-prepared form. David got some noodles with meat on top of it. Each dish was only
380 yen! The store clerks usually ask you if you want to microwave it, and they do it
for you.

We walked around for a long time looking for a trash can for our food containers.
It turns out that finding a trash can in Japan is extremely difficult. We found
a lot of recycling cans but none for regular trash on the street. This was a 
constant problem during our trip! How do they keep the streets clean when there
are no rubbish bins anywhere! We finally found one in a movie theatre and were
free of the trash. Across the street from the movie theatre, we found an arcade!

We played an atypical driving game. Other than a regular racing competition, you
can also play soccer with the cars, and other crazy games. We played soccer, and
Sylvia won because she's amazing.

We also played a taiko game. It was really fun. David got a little too into it...

After that, we decided to go back to the hotel since nothing looked like it was
going to be open for a while. After resting a little bit, we went back to the
market hoping that things would look a little more lively. We weren't disappointed!

We planned to go back to Shijo station since it was close and then go to the
Higashiyama district. Higashiyama is known for it's many temples and since we
were in Kyoto, it was important that we see some!

Higashiyama District
--------------------

One short train ride later, we got to Higashiyama station. Unfortunately, 
we had no idea where the temples actually were. After looking at some maps near
the station, we started walking. Along the way we found a river with small
walking bridges coming across it.

A little more walking, we found a huge temple gate! We tried to take a picture
of ourselves to show a comparison.

Many steps later, we got through the gate and towards the actual temple. Unfortunately,
the temple was under construction until 2019! They even built a building around it
while it was being renovated.

As we were leaving this temple, we saw a bunch of little kids in sailor-esque uniforms.
It was so cute! They fell a lot and it was adorable.

We walked in another direction and found a very pretty pond with koi fish in it.

We wondered around until we found a tori gate which led to other temples.

We kept on walking through the temples, looking for a specific street known for it's
stairs lined with shops. Unforunately, we eventually reached the end of the temples
and exited at the street. We were kind of lost. 

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0146.jpg)

After some mistakes, we kind of found it! Not exactly what we were looking for, but
pretty close. It would have to be good enough because it was very hot, and we were
exhausted.

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0157.jpg)

We walked through the street, and then decided to go back to the hotel since we
were hungry and there weren't a lot of restaurants we found appealing. On
the way back to the train station, we found a river with a walkway that inclined
into the water. For anime-watchers, scenes like this are very common!

Kyoto Shijo
-----------

Back to our hotel, we were starving so we looked for some place to eat. Kyoto didn't
have many options. A lot of the restaurants were traditional style Japanase food, 
which we consumed a lot of in Hakone. We found a small restaurant that served ramen.
We knew we had to try ramen before we left, so we went inside. It was deliciousss!

We went back to the hotel and rested some more. The heat and the humidity really
drained us! After spending some time indoors, we decided to venture out again into
Nishiki Market and Teramachi Street. (Yes, again)

Nishiki Market & Teramachi Street (Again)
-----------------------------------------

We know you're probably thinking that we're crazy for going to the same place again,
but it was the liveliest part of Kyoto we could find. Once we got there, the market
was mostly closed down for the night. 

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0167.jpg)

Teramachi Street also has a few temples squeezed in between stores. 

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0168.jpg)

We found a manga/anime store on the street and went inside. For those of you who
know Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), you will appreciate this! 

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0171.jpg)

We also found a strange illustration book. 

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0172.jpg)

Although the street was mostly full of pedestrians, cars and trucks drove through.
This necessitated some signs to tell pedestrians with children to show caution. 
For some reason, the sign was strange and creepy.

Since we exerted some energy, we obviously needed to eat again. We found an
ice cream store that was kind of pricey, but really delicious. David really enjoyed it.

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0185.jpg)

The streets off of Teramachi Street were also lively and full of lights and restaurants.

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0186.jpg)

We walked off of Teramachi Street and found more streets covered with roofs. 

![]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/kyoto/kyoto_0191.jpg)

We got back on Teramachi Street to find it very packed with people. We assumed that
kids were on a field trip because a ton of them were wearing yellow hats.

Satisfied with everything we saw in Kyoto, we went back to the hotel via the side
streets.

The day after, we would be off to Osaka so we went to bed early. See you next post!
